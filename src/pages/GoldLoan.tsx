  { q: "What type of gold jewellery or coin is accepted as collateral for a gold loan?", a: "Generally, all forms of gold jewellery including rings, chains, necklaces, bangles, etc. are accepted. Gold coins up to 50 grams are also accepted. The gold should be between 18-24 carat purity. Ornaments with high stone content may have reduced valuation as only the gold portion is considered." },
  { q: "What happens to the gold ornaments I use as collateral?", a: "Your gold ornaments are safely stored in the bank's or NBFC's insured vault/locker. They are returned to you in the same condition once you repay the loan in full. The lender is responsible for the safety of your pledged gold during the loan tenure." },
  { q: "Who decides the value of the gold I intend to use as collateral?", a: "The lender's trained gold appraiser evaluates the purity and weight of your gold. The current market rate on the day of pledging is used to determine the value. As per RBI guidelines, the maximum LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratio is 75%." },
  { q: "Is there an option for prepayment in case of a gold loan?", a: "Yes, most lenders allow prepayment of gold loans without any penalty. You can repay the principal and accumulated interest at any time to get your gold back. Some lenders may charge a nominal foreclosure fee." },
  { q: "Do I not have a decent credit score. Can I still get a gold loan?", a: "Yes! Gold loans are secured loans where your gold acts as collateral. Since the risk to the lender is minimal, CIBIL score or credit history is generally not checked. This makes gold loans ideal for individuals with low or no credit scores." },

              <p>
                A Gold Loan is a secured loan that can be availed by pledging gold ornaments or jewellery as collateral with a bank or NBFC. 
                As ornaments or bars of gold act as security, gold loans can be availed for a variety of needs including higher education, 
                wedding expenses, medical emergencies, business expansion, or any other personal needs of cash.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since gold loans are secured loans, they usually offer lower interest rates compared to unsecured loans like personal loans. 
                The loan amount is determined based on the purity and weight of the gold pledged, with the maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio 
                set at 75% by the RBI. Gold loans are popular due to quick processing, minimal documentation, and no requirement of credit score checks.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can find a number of gold loan lenders on CreduPe. We help you compare and choose the best gold loan offer with the lowest 
                interest rates, flexible repayment options, and maximum loan value for your gold.

              Gold jewellery of 18-24 carat purity is accepted. This includes rings, chains, necklaces, bangles, earrings, etc. 
              Gold coins minted by banks (up to 50 grams) are also accepted. Items with excessive stone work may have reduced valuation
