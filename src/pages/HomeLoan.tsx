  { q: "Can I prepay my home loan without penalty?", a: "Yes, as per RBI guidelines, banks cannot charge prepayment penalties on floating rate home loans. You can prepay any amount at any time. Fixed rate loans may have prepayment charges of 2-3%." },
  { q: "What is the maximum tenure for a home loan?", a: "Most banks offer home loans for up to 30 years, subject to the borrower's age at loan maturity not exceeding 60–65 years. Longer tenure means lower EMI but higher total interest paid." },

                A Home Loan is a financial product offered by banks and NBFCs that allows individuals to purchase, construct, or renovate 
                a residential property. The loan amount is repaid in monthly installments (EMIs) over a period of up to 30 years. 
                Home loans are secured loans where the property itself serves as collateral.
              </p>
              <p>
                Home loans offer some of the lowest interest rates among all loan products, starting from 8.35% p.a. Additionally, 
                borrowers can avail significant tax benefits under Section 80C (up to ₹1.5 Lakh on principal) and Section 24(b) 
                (up to ₹2 Lakh on interest) of the Income Tax Act.
              </p>

                <strong className="text-foreground">CreduPe</strong> helps you compare home loan offers from 20+ leading banks and NBFCs
