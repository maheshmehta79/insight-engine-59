const faqs = [
  { q: "What is the minimum salary required to get a credit card?", a: "Most banks require a minimum monthly salary of ₹15,000–₹25,000 for entry-level credit cards. Premium cards may require ₹50,000+ monthly income. Some lifetime free cards like IDFC First and OneCard have lower income thresholds." },
  { q: "How is a credit card different from a debit card?", a: "A credit card lets you borrow money from the bank up to a pre-set limit, while a debit card deducts directly from your bank account. Credit cards offer rewards, EMI options, and help build credit history. You get a billing cycle (typically 45–50 days interest-free) to repay." },
  { q: "What is a credit card billing cycle?", a: "A billing cycle is the period (usually 30 days) between two statement dates. All transactions during this period appear on your monthly statement. You typically get 15–20 days after the statement date (due date) to pay without interest charges." },
  { q: "Does applying for a credit card affect my CIBIL score?", a: "Yes, each credit card application triggers a 'hard inquiry' on your credit report, which can temporarily lower your score by 5–10 points. Multiple applications in a short period can significantly impact your score. Use CreduPe's eligibility checker to check without affecting your score." },
  { q: "What is the minimum amount due on a credit card?", a: "The minimum amount due (MAD) is typically 5% of the total outstanding balance or ₹200, whichever is higher. While paying only MAD avoids late fees, interest (24–42% p.a.) is charged on the remaining balance. Always try to pay the full amount to avoid high interest." },
  { q: "Can I get a credit card with a low CIBIL score?", a: "It's difficult to get a regular credit card with a CIBIL score below 650. However, you can apply for a secured credit card (backed by FD) or cards from NBFCs that have more relaxed criteria. Building good credit habits will improve your score over time." },
  { q: "What are the charges on a credit card?", a: "Common charges include: Annual/renewal fee (₹0–₹12,500+), interest on revolving credit (24–42% p.a.), late payment fee (₹100–₹1,300), cash advance fee (2.5%), foreign currency markup (1–3.5%), over-limit fee, and GST (18%) on all fees and interest." },
  { q: "How can I increase my credit card limit?", a: "You can increase your limit by: maintaining a good repayment track record, increasing card usage, updating salary/income details with the bank, requesting a limit enhancement through the bank's app/website, or getting a new card with a higher limit from another bank." },

                With a wide range of options available in the market, choosing the right credit card can be a difficult task. 
                The best credit cards in India are designed to offer an array of benefits, including cashback, rewards and other deals, 
                that are tailored to varied lifestyles and needs ranging from travel to shopping.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important to compare credit cards from different issuers and apply for a credit card that helps you save on shopping, 
                travel, dining and other spending categories, as per your preferences. Credit cards allow cardholders to borrow up to a 
                predefined credit limit to pay for goods and services.
              </p>
