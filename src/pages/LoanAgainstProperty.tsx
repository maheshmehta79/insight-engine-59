const faqs = [
  { q: "What is a Loan Against Property?", a: "A Loan Against Property (LAP) is a secured loan where you pledge your residential or commercial property as collateral to avail funds. You continue to retain ownership and use of the property while repaying the loan in EMIs." },
  { q: "How is Loan Against Property different from a Home Loan?", a: "A home loan can only be used for purchasing, constructing, or renovating a property. LAP can be used for any purpose — business expansion, education, medical emergencies, debt consolidation, or personal needs. LAP typically has slightly higher interest rates and lower LTV ratios compared to home loans." },
  { q: "What is the maximum amount I can get as LAP?", a: "You can typically get 60-75% of the property's market value as a loan. The exact amount depends on the lender, property type, location, your income, and credit profile." },
  { q: "Which properties are accepted for LAP?", a: "Most lenders accept residential apartments, independent houses, commercial offices, shops, and plots. The property must be freehold with a clear title and located within municipal/corporation limits." },
  { q: "What is the eligibility criteria for LAP?", a: "Both salaried and self-employed individuals can apply. Key criteria include a minimum age of 25, income above ₹30,000/month (salaried) or ₹5L annual (self-employed), CIBIL score of 700+, and an unencumbered property with clear title." },
  { q: "Can I prepay or foreclose LAP?", a: "Yes, for floating rate LAP, banks cannot charge prepayment or foreclosure penalties as per RBI guidelines. For fixed rate LAP, a penalty of 2-4% may be applicable." },
  { q: "What is the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio for LAP?", a: "LTV for LAP typically ranges from 50-75% depending on the lender and property type. Residential properties usually get a higher LTV compared to commercial properties." },
  { q: "Is it mandatory to have property insurance for LAP?", a: "Yes, most lenders mandate property insurance for the tenure of the loan. This protects both the borrower and lender in case of any damage to the property." },
  { q: "What are the tax benefits of Loan Against Property?", a: "If LAP is used for business purposes, the interest paid is deductible under Section 37(1) as a business expense. If used for home purchase/construction, benefits under Section 24(b) and 80C apply." },
  { q: "How long does LAP disbursement take?", a: "After all documents are submitted, LAP disbursement typically takes 7-15 working days. This includes property valuation, legal verification, and final approval." },
  { q: "Can NRIs avail Loan Against Property?", a: "Yes, some lenders offer LAP to NRIs. The property must be in India and the NRI should meet additional criteria like power of attorney, NRE/NRO account statements, and employment documents from abroad." },

            A Loan Against Property (LAP) is a secured loan where borrowers pledge their residential or commercial property as collateral to avail funds from a bank or NBFC. The borrower continues to retain ownership and use of the property while repaying the loan through EMIs. LAP is one of the most cost-effective borrowing options as interest rates are significantly lower compared to unsecured loans like personal loans.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The loan amount sanctioned is typically 50-75% of the property's market value, known as the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. LAP can be used for any purpose including business expansion, education, medical emergencies, debt consolidation, wedding expenses, or home renovation — making it highly versatile.
