  { q: "What is the maximum age of a used car that qualifies for a loan?", a: "Most banks require the car to not be older than 5-7 years at the time of purchase, and the total age (existing + loan tenure) should not exceed 10-12 years at loan maturity. Some lenders like SBI and HDFC allow cars up to 10 years old." },
  { q: "How is the loan amount for a used car determined?", a: "The loan amount is based on the car's current market value (depreciated value), not the original price. Banks typically finance 70-85% of the evaluated market value. The valuation is done by an authorized evaluator appointed by the bank." },
  { q: "Is a used car loan interest rate higher than a new car loan?", a: "Yes, used car loan interest rates are typically 2-5% higher than new car loan rates. This is because used cars are considered higher risk due to depreciation and potential mechanical issues. Rates usually range from 11.50% to 16% p.a." },
  { q: "Can I get a used car loan for a car purchased from a private seller?", a: "Yes, most banks offer used car loans for cars purchased from both authorized dealers and private sellers. However, loans for dealer purchases may get better terms and faster processing due to easier verification." },
  { q: "What happens if the used car I bought has a pending loan?", a: "You should always check for pending loans using the VAHAN portal or RTO records before purchase. If a car has a pending loan, the seller must get an NOC from the existing lender before transfer. CreduPe recommends always verifying this before finalizing any deal." },
  { q: "Are there any prepayment charges on used car loans?", a: "As per RBI guidelines, floating rate loans do not have prepayment or foreclosure charges. However, fixed rate used car loans may attract a penalty of 2-5% of outstanding principal. Always check with your lender before prepaying." },

              <p>
                A Used Car Loan (also called a Pre-Owned Car Loan or Second-Hand Car Loan) is a secured loan offered by banks and NBFCs 
                to help you purchase a pre-owned vehicle. The car itself serves as collateral for the loan, making it more affordable than 
                taking a personal loan for buying a used car.
              </p>
              <p>
                Used car loans typically come with slightly higher interest rates compared to new car loans — starting from 11.50% p.a. — 
                but they are significantly cheaper than personal loans (which can go up to 18-24% p.a.). Most banks finance 70-85% of the 
                car's current market value, with tenure options of 12 to 60 months depending on the car's age.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-foreground">CreduPe</strong> helps you compare used car loan offers from 50+ leading banks and NBFCs,
