const faqData = [
  { q: "What is a business loan and who can apply?", a: "A business loan is a type of financing provided to businesses for various purposes like expansion, working capital, equipment purchase, or any other legitimate business need. Self-employed professionals, sole proprietors, partnership firms, private limited companies, and LLPs with a minimum business vintage of 2-3 years can apply." },
  { q: "What is the maximum loan amount I can get?", a: "For unsecured business loans, you can typically get up to ₹50 Lakh depending on your business turnover, profitability, and credit profile. For secured business loans (with collateral), the amount can go up to ₹5 Crore or more." },
  { q: "What is the interest rate for business loans?", a: "Business loan interest rates start from 14% p.a. and can go up to 24% p.a. depending on the lender, your business profile, credit score, turnover, and loan amount. Secured loans generally have lower interest rates than unsecured loans." },
  { q: "Can I get a business loan without collateral?", a: "Yes, many banks and NBFCs offer unsecured business loans (without collateral) up to ₹50 Lakh. However, the interest rates may be slightly higher compared to secured business loans. Government schemes like CGTMSE also provide collateral-free loans to MSMEs." },
  { q: "What is the minimum CIBIL score required for a business loan?", a: "Most lenders prefer a CIBIL score of 700 and above for business loans. However, some NBFCs may consider applications with scores as low as 650, though at higher interest rates." },
  { q: "How long does it take to get a business loan disbursed?", a: "Once all documents are verified and the loan is approved, disbursement typically happens within 24-72 hours for unsecured loans. For secured loans, it may take 7-10 working days due to property verification and legal checks." },
  { q: "Can startups get a business loan?", a: "Yes, startups can avail business loans through government schemes like Mudra Loan (up to ₹10 Lakh), PMEGP, and Stand-Up India. Some NBFCs also offer startup-specific loan products, though they may require a minimum 1-year business vintage." },
  { q: "What happens if I miss an EMI payment?", a: "Missing an EMI payment attracts penalty charges of 2-3% per month on the outstanding amount. Repeated defaults negatively impact your CIBIL score, making future borrowing difficult. In case of secured loans, the lender may initiate recovery proceedings against the collateral." },

                A business loan is a financial product designed to help entrepreneurs, small business owners, and enterprises meet their funding requirements. Whether you need capital for expansion, working capital management, equipment purchase, or any other business need, a business loan provides the necessary funds with flexible repayment options.
              </p>
              <p>

Secured business loans, backed by property or other assets, offer higher loan amounts up to <strong className="text-foreground">₹5 Crore</strong> at comparatively lower interest rates.
